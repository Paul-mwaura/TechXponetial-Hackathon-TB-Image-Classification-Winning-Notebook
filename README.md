# TechXponetial-Hackathon-TB-Image-Classification-Winning-Notebook
The main objective of this study is to build a model that can classify a lung that has been infected with Tuberculosis and a normal lung using images of chest x-rays.
Understanding the context

With Tuberculosis infections still active as the COVID-19 pandemic continues, an automated tool to help identify TB has the potential to reduce hospital workload and optimize patient care during a time when hospitals are being overwhelmed by COVID-19 cases. Zindi Africa, launched this challenge in search of a solution to this.

Tuberculosis (TB) is a global disease, found in every country in the world. It is the leading infectious cause of death worldwide. The World Health Organization estimates that 1.8 billion people—close to one quarter of the world's population—are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb), the bacteria that causes TB. In 2018, 10 million fell ill from TB and 1.5 million died. TB is responsible for economic devastation and the cycle of poverty and illness that entraps families, communities and even entire countries. Among the most vulnerable are women, children, and those with HIV/AIDS. There is growing resistance to available drugs, which means the disease is becoming more deadly and difficult to treat. There were more than half a million cases of drug resistant TB last year.

## What is Tuberculosis?

Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease caused by a germ called Mycobacterium tuberculosis that is spread from person to person through the air. TB usually affects the lungs, but it can also affect other parts of the body, such as the brain, the kidneys, or the spine.

## How is Tuberculosis spread?

When a person with infectious TB coughs or sneezes, droplet nuclei containing M. tuberculosis are expelled into the air. If another person inhales air containing these droplet nuclei, he or she may become infected. However, not everyone infected with TB bacteria becomes sick. As a result, two TB-related conditions exist: latent TB infection and TB disease

## Latent TB infection (LTBI)

Persons with latent TB infection do not feel sick and do not have any symptoms. They are infected with M. tuberculosis, but do not have TB disease. Persons with latent TB infection are not infectious and cannot spread TB infection to others. TB Disease In some people, TB bacteria overcome the defenses of the immune system and begin to multiply, resulting in the progression from latent TB infection to TB disease. Some people develop TB disease soon after infection, while others develop TB disease later when their immune system becomes weak. Some symptoms of TB disease include: Unexplained weight loss, Loss of appetite, Night sweats, Fever, Fatigue and Chills Diagnosis The following tests can be used to detect TB bacteria in the body; TB skin test A small amount of a substance called PPD tuberculin is injected just below the skin of your inside forearm. You should feel only a slight needle prick.Within 48 to 72 hours, a health care professional will check your arm for swelling at the injection site. A hard, raised red bump means you're likely to have TB infection. The size of the bump determines whether the test results are significant.

TB blood tests may be used to confirm or rule out latent or active tuberculosis. These tests use sophisticated technology to measure your immune system's reaction to TB bacteria.These tests require only one office visit. A blood test may be useful if you're at high risk of TB infection but have a negative response to the skin test, or if you've recently received the BCG vaccine. Imaging tests If you've had a positive skin test, your doctor is likely to order a chest X-ray or a CT scan.On a chest x-ray from someone with TB you can often see the cavitation that the TB bacteria form in the lung tissue. TB cavities are often in the upper parts of the lung, also known as the apex. This may be white spots in your lungs where your immune system has walled off TB bacteria, or it may reveal changes in your lungs which could be caused by active tuberculosis or other things that are not necessarily TB hence chest x-rays have poor specificity. Therefore chest x-rays are usually an indicator of whether or not a person might have TB, but they cannot confirm the diagnosis. They are used to confirm a suspicion, and will always be followed by tests that aim at finding the TB bacterium. The diagnosis of TB cannot be made by a chest x-ray alone. It can also not be excluded by a chest x-ray.CT scans provide more-detailed images than do X-rays. Sputum tests If your chest X-ray shows signs of tuberculosis, your doctor may take samples of your sputum — the mucus that comes up when you cough. The samples are tested for TB bacteria.Sputum samples can also be used to test for drug-resistant strains of TB. This helps your doctor choose the medications that are most likely to work. These tests can take four to eight weeks to be completed. The symptoms of TB of the lungs include; Coughing for 3 weeks or longer Hemoptysis (coughing up blood) Chest pain Other symptoms depend on the part of the body that is affected.
